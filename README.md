# Long-term-Investor-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-Engaging-with-the-Investment-Community
This project will aim to employ machine learning for the task of predicting the efficacy of telemarketing campaigns run by banking institutions.

## Overview

This repository embodies a machine learning project that analyzes the customer data of one of the leading investment banks. Here, I predicted long-term deposit makers and investors in order to enhance customer engagement, optimize resource allocation, and drive long-term profitability as far as the investment bank is concerned. This project will be carried out using the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining *(CRISP-DM)* methodology, which generally is characterized by six phases.

## CRISP-DM <br>
1. Business understanding.
2. Data understanding.
3. Data preparation.
4. Data modelling.
5. Model Evaluation.
6. Model development.


## Objectives

This would be an immense boon to them in the following ways:

1. Provide a likelihood estimation as to the chances of a customer buying long-term deposits.
2. Provide good plan as to the customers to focus more attention on.
3. Provide some information as to the efficacy of telemarketing campaigns.
